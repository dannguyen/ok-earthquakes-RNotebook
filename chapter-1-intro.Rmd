> “We here at the geological survey feel the interpretation that best fits the current data is that the Prague earthquake was the result of natural causes,” OGS seismologist Austin Holland said. “All the data is consistent with a natural earthquake. The data does not require it to have any cause other than the natural accumulation of stress and that release.”

> The geological survey pointed out that Oklahoma has experienced more than 10 magnitude 4.0 or greater earthquakes since the previous record 5.0 El Reno earthquake in 1952.
